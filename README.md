Simple landing page for a fake company

The background is a free stock image that provides context as well as contrast due to its dark colour.
The colour scheme is neutral to represent the professionalism and class of the business. The font is a simple serif font for the same reason.
The buttons change colour when hovered over to improve interactibility.
The record logo in the top-left corner spins when hovered over to add an interesting element.
